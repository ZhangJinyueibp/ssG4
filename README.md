# ssG4
DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) are four-stranded structures formed by guanine-rich sequences in mammalian genomes, but their strand-specific localization and transcriptional regulatory roles are not fully understood. We developed a strand-specific G4 sequencing (ssG4-seq) method to map G4 structures globally across multiple mammalian genomes. This approach confirms known G4s and uncovers thousands of novel G4s in human K562 cells. Our findings show that over 95% of G4s are located in enhancers and promoters across species. Notably, promoters with G4s on both strands exhibit significantly stronger transcriptional activation than those with G4s on a single strand. We also identify transcription factor SP1 as a G4 reader that modulates transcription by facilitating enhancer-promoter looping. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cancer-associated mutations can disrupt G4 structures and SP1-mediated enhancer-promoter interactions, promoting tumorigenesis. This study highlights the utility of ssG4-seq in exploring G4 structures, functions, and regulatory mechanisms across species and diseases.
